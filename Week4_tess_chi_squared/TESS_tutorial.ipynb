    "# Recovering the first TESS Planet Candidate Using the *Lightkurve* Package\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is almost entirely from the [TESS *Lightkurve* Tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/github/KeplerGO/lightkurve/blob/master/docs/source/tutorials/02-how-to-recover-the-first-tess-candidate.ipynb#scrollTo=Ly6zjNqvzIqW) written by Geert Barentsen.\n",

    "This is a quick tutorial on how to get started using *Lightkurve* to access and analyze the TESS data. This tutorial takes a look at the target Pi Mensae (Tess Input Catalog ID 261136679) which was the first planet candidate discovered in the TESS data by [Huang et al. (2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.05967). We're going to use *Lightkurve* to rediscover the candidate.\n",
    "\n",
    "To detect a transiting exoplanet, we observe the brightness of a star over time. A transiting exoplanet should create a dip in brightness corresponding to radial size of the orbiting planet. TESS takes images of ~200,000 stars every two minutes, and millions-to-billions stars every half hour. Pi Mensae is one of the stars that is observed every two minutes by the TESS mission. These observations are optical images, called Target Pixel Files (TPFs) and stored online for public access."
